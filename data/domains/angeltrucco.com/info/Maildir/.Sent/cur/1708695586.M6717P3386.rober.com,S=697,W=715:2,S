This solved my problem and I can run apt update and other things.

note: this solution is a temporary solution. I'll let you know if I find 
a permanent solution.

edit: I've found the solution. The problem occurs if your disk has lots 
of bad sectors. You have to ignore these bad sectors on the disk.
